# final-project239
* My topic is to find a suitable ZCTA for my father to live after his retirement.And I involved sex factor to calculate the unweighted score.Ther are community,hospital,fire station,farmer market,the percentage of people who are 60 and over 60 and Percentage (%) of pixel area covered by tree canopy (0-100).And I divided each categelory in five classes and use 1 to 5 to represent them.1 means the worst and 5 means the best.For the percentage of people who are 60 and over 60,this factor is helpful for my father to amke friends at his age and they can communicate with each other so the percentage is larger, the score is higher.The community,hospital,fire station and farmer market are convenient for his living so I calculate the density of these facilities of each ZCTA.The density is higher.the score is higher.And the last factor is about environment.Staying with more trees and vegetables is helpful for people's health.In this part I used zonal Statistics to calculate the mean of the percentage of each ZCTA.The mean is higher,the score is higher.And then we got the best ZCTA.
* I used python to right this project and I also upload the environment and the data we need.You can see the html and note book version of my project and you can also download the environment and data to run it by yourself.
* In this project I used rasterio(show,zonal_stats) numpy pandas geopandas and matpolib.pyplot.
* Data is downloaded on the website that the professor provided and the code is all by my self.
